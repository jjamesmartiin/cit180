If we define a governor’s term in office as yearto minus yearfrom, list the govnum, first name, middle initial, last name, and term (use alias "term in office") of each governor whose term is something other than the conventional 4 years or 8 years. Use the IN operator to filter. The governor with the longest term should be at the top of the list, with governors having the same term in office in govnum order.

SELECT govnum, govfname, govmi, govlname, yearto-yearfrom AS "term in office"
FROM nvgovernors_xx
